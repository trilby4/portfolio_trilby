            </h1>
            <p>Life as a renter, especially when experiencing issues in their home
                can leave a person feeling stressed and disillusioned. I set out to
                create an accessible & affordable solution for renters. Knowing that
                you’re getting 100% accurate legal advice, affordably can really
                help a renter that’s having problems with their landlord.</p>

                        Knowing when and how to address issues with your landlord or management

                        Not only to test the validity of my assumptions but to get a better understanding of the
                        market and to refine my project, I conducted competitive analysis, and conducted 5
                        users interviews. Doing this research helped me identify gaps among existing legal
                        advice-giving apps, it also helped me understand my users’ needs and pain points.

                        <li>then if they still feel unsure what the law is saying then they will want to
                            double check with a legal expert. </li>

                        Due to business requirements we will still launch with a focus on the chat with a
                        lawyer feature but will include more self-serve information and documents,
                        working to improve these resources incrementally.

                        I set out to create a responsive web app that not only connects renters to lawyers
                        at an affordable rate but also has an in depth self-serve capability.

                    <p>
                        During my research, I discovered (or confirmed) that renters...
                        <li>
                            are mostly unwilling to pay for expert legal advice
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            face obstacles knowing what their rights are
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            need advice tailored to their specific issues
                        </li>

                        With these insights in mind, I crafted personas to capture the needs,
                        motivations, and demographics of my users. Then I created user
                        journeys to pinpoint opportunities for my app to address these needs
                        along the way. Here’s Dezo as an example:

                        To assess reSides’s usability for new users interacting with the web app for the first
                        time on mobile, I gathered a diverse group of 6 participants who are currently renters
                        or were renting in the recent past (aged 30- 62) for moderated remote usability tests.
                        These tests prompted me to make the following 3 major changes on my final
                        prototype:

                    <p>
                        The icons were simplified into text and then the top nav bar was further refined.

                        The payment method requirement was dropped and account creation was moved to after users write

                        While there was always self-serve options we will now work to make these sections more robust
                        and post launch we’ll
                        focus our efforts to see how we can create the content our users want and need.
