            <p>Life as a renter, especially when experiencing issues in their home
                can leave a person feeling stressed and disillusioned. I set out to
                create an accessible & affordable solution for renters. Knowing that
                you’re getting 100% accurate legal advice, affordably can really
                help a renter that’s having problems with their landlord.</p>

                Not only to test the validity of my assumptions but to get a better understanding of the
                market and to refine my project, I conducted competitive analysis, and conducted 5
                users interviews. Doing this research helped me identify gaps among existing legal
                advice-giving apps, it also helped me understand my users’ needs and pain points.

                I set out to create a <span>responsive web app</span> that not only connects renters to lawyers

            <p>
                During my research, I discovered (or confirmed) that renters...
                <li>
                    are mostly <span>unwilling to pay</span> for expert legal advice

                    face obstacles knowing what their rights are

                    need advice tailored to their specific issues

                With these insights in mind, I crafted <span>personas</span> to capture the needs,
                motivations, and demographics of my users. Then I created <span>≈user
                    journeys</span> to pinpoint opportunities for my app to address these needs
                along the way. Here’s Dezo as an example:

                These tests prompted me to make the following 3 major changes on my final

                While there was always self-serve options we will now work to make these sections more robust
                and post launch we’ll
                focus our efforts to see how we can create the content our users want and need.
